This repo contains the (very simple!) html code of my webpage.

One might think that websites involving nothing but simple HTML code will look outdated and unprofessional.

On the contrary, I think they load faster, are very functional, and virtually anyone with an internet connection can make one in a couple of hours for free. Why drive a big SUV when you can ride your bike?
